<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This is only for maintainers with publishing access</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the records are published using a manual github actions workflow.
When all the PR&#39;s are merged and ready, go to <code>Actions &gt; Publish records</code> and click on the <code>Run workflow</code> button to publish the merged records.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may log an error message while publishing saying some record(s) couldn&#39;t be published.
Usually, the cause is related to some conflict while deleting and re-publishing.
In those situations, running the workflow again will fix the issues.</p>
